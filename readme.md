# ISIC Skin Cancer Challenge 2018

This repo is a learning and practising project of image 
segmentation with deep neural networks. The challenge 
problem is defined and organized by
[international Skin Imaging Collaboration](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/).

We will utilize several state of arts image segmentation 
algorithm and compare the performance.

The initial data loading and training pipeline is based on
an online tutorial 
[Creating and training a U-Net model with PyTorch for 2D & 3D semantic segmentation: Dataset building](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-and-training-a-u-net-model-with-pytorch-for-2d-3d-semantic-segmentation-dataset-fb1f7f80fe55)
